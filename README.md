## Improvements I Would Like to Implement

Given more time I would like to have added a User class and database in order to manage user registration, so that users have to sign up to Chitter before they're allowed to post.

Ideally I'd also have used CSS to pimp up the design; as it is I left it plain and focused on the development, as it was my first time using databases.
